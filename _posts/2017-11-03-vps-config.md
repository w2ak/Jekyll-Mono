*How I would configure my vps for the first time. Instructions on a Debian host.*

---

# Notations

I will call my computer `laptop`, my server `server` at the address `example.com`
with ip `93.184.216.34`. On both sides my username will be `neze`.

# Initial setup of access

## Remove root ssh access

### Remove password root ssh access

  * Create an ssh key on `laptop`.

```sh
neze@laptop ~ % ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 521 -f ~/.ssh/id_example.com -C "neze@laptop"
# -t: cryptographic algorithm. Values: rsa,ecdsa,ed25519.
# -b: key size. Values: minimum 1024 for rsa (at least 2048 advised),
#     256 384 or 521 for ecdsa, no value for ed25519
```

*This command will ask for a passphrase. If you do not trust your laptop, choose a strong passphrase.*

  * Configure your laptop to correctly use the ssh key.

```sh
neze@laptop ~ % cat << EOF >> ~/.ssh/config
Host example.com
    HostName 93.184.216.34
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_example.com
```

  * Copy the identity file to `root@server`.

```sh
neze@laptop ~ % ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_example.com.pub root@example.com
# -i: Path to the public identity file.
```

  * Check that you can connect to `root@server` without password.

```sh
neze@laptop ~ % ssh root@example.com
```

Keep this shell open until you finish this part.

  * Disable password login for root.

```sh
root@server ~ % vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

```diff
-PermitRootLogin yes
+PermitRootLogin prohibit-password
```

```sh
root@server ~ % systemctl restart ssh.service
```

  * Check in another terminal that you still have access to the server.

```sh
neze@laptop ~ % ssh root@example.com "echo OK"
OK
```

  * Check that you do not have password access anymore.

```sh
neze@laptop ~ % ssh -o PreferredAuthentications=password root@example.com
root@93.184.216.34's password:
Permission denied, please try again.
```

### Create your main user

  * Create your user.

```sh
root@server ~ % adduser neze
```

  * Put the user in the sudo group.

```sh
root@server ~ % usermod -aG sudo neze
```

  * Copy your ssh public key to this user on the server.

```sh
neze@laptop ~ % ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_example.com.pub neze@example.com
neze@93.184.216.34's password:
```

  * Check that you have access to your user's shell.

```sh
neze@laptop ~ % ssh neze@example.com "echo OK"
OK
```

  * Disable root login

```sh
root@server ~ % vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

```diff
-PermitRootLogin prohibit-password
+PermitRootLogin no
```

```sh
root@server ~ % systemctl restart ssh.service
```

  * Check that you still have access to your user's shell.

```sh
neze@laptop ~ % ssh neze@example.com "echo OK"
OK
```

  * Maybe completely disable password authentication.

```sh
neze@laptop ~ % ssh neze@example.com
neze@server ~ % sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

```diff
-PasswordAuthentication yes
+PasswordAuthentication no
```

```sh
neze@server ~ % sudo systemctl restart ssh.service
```
