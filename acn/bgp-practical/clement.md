# Multi-homed network

## Question 1.1

*Configure the BGP router of AS10 to prohibit transit.*

For each AS2,6,9 (they are providers), add the community "local-AS" on incoming
routes such that they are not advertized for these routes will be deleted on
output.

{% foldhl text linenos %}
 enable
 configure terminal
 router bgp 10
  neighbor 100.0.0.2 route-map rm-prov2-in in
  neighbor 100.0.0.6 route-map rm-prov6-in in
  neighbor 100.0.0.9 route-map rm-prov9-in in
  exit
 route-map rm-prov2-in permit 10
  set community local-AS
  exit
 route-map rm-prov6-in permit 10
  set community local-AS
  exit
 route-map rm-prov9-in permit 10
  set community local-AS
  exit
 exit
{% endfoldhl %}

## Question 1.2

*Explain the changes needed in the BGP configuration so as to route **outgoing**
internet traffic from AS10 through either AS9 or AS6 but not through AS2. AS2
must only be used as a last resort.*

Add a local preference to each AS such that routes going through AS6 or AS9 are
prefered.

{% foldhl text linenos %}
 enable
 configure terminal
 route-map rm-prov2-in permit 10
  set local-preference 100
  exit
 route-map rm-prov6-in permit 10
  set local-preference 200
  exit
 route-map rm-prov9-in permit 10
  set local-preference 200
  exit
 exit
{% endfoldhl %}

## Question 1.3

*Explain the changes needed so as to route the **incoming** traffic through AS6
or AS9 and not through AS2.*

Path prepending can be used to shape incoming traffic.

{% foldhl text linenos %}
 enable
 configure terminal
 router bgp 10
  neighbor 100.0.0.2 route-map rm-prov2-out out
  exit
 route-map rm-prov2-out permit 10
  set as-path prepend 10 10 10
  exit
 exit
{% endfoldhl %}

## Question 1.4

*How can the shaping applied by AS10 for the incoming traffic be bypassed by other ASs?*

Peers can still bypass path prepending with their local preferences.

## Questions 1.1-4 reset

{% foldhl text linenos %}
 enable
 configure terminal
 router bgp 10
  no neighbor 100.0.0.2 route-map rm-prov2-in in
  no neighbor 100.0.0.2 route-map rm-prov2-out out
  no neighbor 100.0.0.6 route-map rm-prov6-in in
  no neighbor 100.0.0.9 route-map rm-prov9-in in
  exit
 no route-map rm-prov2-in permit 10
 no route-map rm-prov2-out permit 10
 no route-map rm-prov6-in permit 10
 no route-map rm-prov9-in permit 10
 exit
{% endfoldhl %}

# Carriers

## Question 2.1

Some AS do not see every possible route towards AS10 because, in the
advertisement process, every router only advertises its best path towards AS10.
For example, `1-5-8-9-10` will not be found in the table of AS1 because the best
path from AS5 to AS10 is actually `5-6-10`. *Every router can only have one path
per neighbor.*

Another important element is Poison Reverse. AS1 uses `1-5-6-10` as its best
path. It will not advertise it to AS5 __because the next hop in this path is
AS5__. AS5 only sees paths for next hops AS6 and AS8. *Every router can only
have __at most__ one path per neighbor.*

### Theoretical routes advertisement

{% foldhl text linenos %}
 Step 0.
  AS10 advertises [10]
               to {2,6,9}
 Step 1. {2,6,9} received an advertisement
  AS2  now has [2,10]
       advertises [2,10]
               to {1,3,10} - {10} = {1,3}
  AS6  now has [6,10]
       advertises [6,10]
               to {3,5,10} - {10} = {3,5}
  AS9  now has [9,10]
       advertises [9,10]
               to {7,8,10} - {10} = {7,8}
 Step 2. {1,3,5,7,8} received an advertisement
  AS1  now has [1,2,10]
       advertises [1,2,10]
               to {2,3,4,5} - {2,10} = {3,4,5}
  AS3  now has [3,2,10]
               [3,6,10]
       advertises [3,2,10]
               to {1,2,6} - {2,10} = {1,6}
  AS5  now has [5,6,10]
       advertises [5,6,10]
               to {1,6,8} - {6,10} = {1,8}
  AS7  now has [7,9,10]
       advertises [7,9,10]
               to {4,9} - {9,10} = {4}
  AS8  now has [8,9,10]
       advertises [8,9,10]
               to {5,9} - {9,10} = {5}
 Step 3. {1,3,4,5,6,8} received an advertisement
  AS1  now has [1,2,10]
               [1,3,2,10]
               [1,5,6,10]
       does not advertise [1,2,10]
  AS3  now has [3,2,10]
               [3,2,10]
               [3,1,2,10]
       does not advertise [3,2,10]
  AS4  now has [4,1,2,10]
               [4,7,9,10]
       advertises [4,1,2,10]
               to {1,7} - {1,2,10} = {7}
  AS5  now has [5,6,10]
               [5,1,2,10]
               [5,8,9,10]
       does not advertise [5,6,10]
  AS6  now has [6,10]
               [6,3,2,10]
       does not advertise [6,10]
  AS8  now has [8,9,10]
               [8,5,6,10]
       does not advertise [8,9,10]
 Step 4. {7} received an advertisement
  AS7  now has [7,9,10]
               [7,4,1,2,10]
       does not advertise [7,9,10]
{% endfoldhl %}

In the end, we expect the following paths towards 10.

{% endfoldhl %}

In the end, AS10 routes towards AS1 are

{% foldhl text linenos %}
 +------+--------+-----+
 | src  | path   | dst |
 +------+--------+-----+
 |      |>     2 |     |

This can be checked in the BGP router of AS10.

### Route from AS8 to AS10

According to the detailed theoretical propagation of routes towards AS10,
routes in AS8 should be

{% foldhl text linenos %}
 +-----+------+------+
 | src | path | dst  |
 +-----+------+------+
 | AS8 |>   9 | AS10 |
 |     |  5 6 |      |
 +-----+------+------+
{% endfoldhl %}

Actually, there is only one route in the router of AS8.

{% foldhl text linenos %}
 AS8# sh ip bgp 10.0.0.0
 BGP routing table entry for 10.0.0.0/8, version 46
 BGP Bestpath: compare-routerid
 Paths: (1 available, best #1, table default)
   Advertised to update-groups:
      2
   Refresh Epoch 2
   9 10
     100.0.89.9 from 100.0.89.9 (9.9.9.2)
       Origin IGP, localpref 300, valid, external, best
       Community: 300
       rx pathid: 0, tx pathid: 0x0
{% endfoldhl %}

This is because before advertising a new route to its neighbours, a BGP router
will first advertise to every neighbour (no filter) the fact that it is removing
the old route.

## Question 2.4

Internal BGP settings (OSPF settings, actually) in router `AS9.4` consider the
link `AS9.4-AS9.3` to cost less than `AS9.4-AS9.2`. This forces the choice of
`AS7` without having to tie break because of Hot potato.

## Question 2.5

Choice of `AS8` as a next hop can be forced by configuring `AS9.4`.

 configure terminal
 interface GigabitEthernet0/2
  ip ospf cost 12
  exit
 exit
