# Exercise 1

*Questions on PHY, MAC and RLC layers of LTE.*

## PHY Layer

  * What are the transmission and multiplexing techniques in DL and UL?

  [OFDMA][ofdma] (for DownLink) and [SC-FDMA][scfdma] (for UpLink) are used as
  multiplexing techniques
  (see [page 18](/share/acn/906/03-lte-phy-mac-rlc.pdf#page=18)).

  [OFDM][ofdm] ([page 20](/share/acn/906/03-lte-phy-mac-rlc.pdf#page=20)):
  Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing

  * What are the modulations in DL and UL?

  Used modulations are [BPSK][bpsk] (Bi Phase Shift Key), [QPSK][qpsk]
  (Quadri Phase Shift Key), [16-QAM][16qam] (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation)
  and [64-QAM][64qam].

  For DownLink, [64-QAM][64qam] is required on any terminal by LTE. For UpLink,
  [64-QAM][64qam] is available only on cat5 terminals.

  * What is the duplexing scheme?

  Possible duplexing schemes are [TDD][tdd] (Time Division Duplexing) and
  [FDD][fdd] (Frequency Division Duplexing).

  * What are the main spectrum bands used in 4G in France?

  `800, 1800, 2600 MHz`
  ([page 19](/share/acn/906/03-lte-phy-mac-rlc.pdf#page=19))

  * What are the advantages and drawbacks of OFDM?

  OFDM reduces multi-path propagation issues
  ([page 20](/share/acn/906/03-lte-phy-mac-rlc.pdf#page=20)):
  [ISI][isi] (Inter Symbol Interference) is almost completely removed. Since the
  orthogonality allows overlaps, it also provides a higher spectral efficiency.

  On the other side, it creates inter-carrier interference
  ([page 26](/share/acn/906/03-lte-phy-mac-rlc.pdf#page=26)) and a high
  [PAPR][papr] (Peak to Average Power Ratio)

  * Why is it important to reduce the PAPR on the UL?

  A high [PAPR][papr] on the UL requires terminals to transmit at a high power
  to allow amplificators to read the signal. Terminals cannot transmit with
  higher powers which is why the [PAPR][papr] should be reduced.

  * What is the subcarrier bandwidth?

  The sub-carrier bandwidth is `15kHz`
  ([page 30](/share/acn/906/03-lte-phy-mac-rlc.pdf#page=30)).

  The carrier bandwidth can be `1.4`, `3`, `5`, `10`, `15` or `20MHz`.

  * What is a single frequency network?

  On a [SFN][sfn] (Single Frequency Network), every cell uses the same
  frequency.

  * What are the typical MIMO configurations?
  * What are the potential gains in MIMO?
  * What is the difference between open loop and closed loop schemes?
  * What are the advantages and drawbacks of beamforming?
  * Describe the FDD radio frame structure with normal prefix.
  * What is a RE? a RB?

## Physical, transport and logical channels

  * Are there dedicated channels in LTE?
  * How does a UE acquire the physical cell identity?
  * How does a UE learn the signal bandwidth?
  * How many OFDM symbols are occupied by PDCCH?
  * How is a UE informedof this number?
  * On which physical channel is done resource allocation?
  * What is the difference between PUSCH and PUCCH?
  * What is the difference between DMRS and SRS?
  * What is the advantage of frequency hopping on PDSCH and PUSCH?
  * On which transport channels are transmitted System Informations?
  * What type of information is carried by DCIs?
  * Which DCI is used for resource allocation on the UL?
  * On which physical channel are UCI transmitted?
  * On which logical channels are signaling message transmitted when the UE has no RRC connection? When it has a RRC connection?

## MAC/RLC sublayers

  * In which layers are located HARQ and ARQ functions?
  * What are the RLC modes?
  * Give one function of PDCP.

# Exercise 2

*Channels for the outgoing call.*

Indicate on figures 1 and 2 the physical, transport and logical channel used.

# Exercise 3

*Peak data rates in LTE*

  * What is the largest signal bandwidth? What is the corresponding number of RBs?
  * We assume a normal prefix. How many OFDM symbols are there per slot? Per radio frame? Deduce the number of REs per radio frame.
  * What is the minimum number of REs used by PDCCH, PCFICH and PHICH?
  * How many REs are used by SSS, PSS and PBCH?
  * Give an estimation of the protocol overhead due to RSs for a 4 antenna transmission.
  * What is the denser modulation in LTE? What is the maximum number of MIMO parallel flows? What is the duration of a radio frame? Deduce the raw peak data rate.
  * We assume a coding rate of `3/4`. Deduce the peak data rate in DL.
  * Discuss the validity of the preceding result.
